# IODS-final
Maija Absetz/8.3.2017
Final assignment for introduction to open data science

Final assignment includes creating your own web page, and wrangling and analysing data with the chosen method.

Whole project has taught me to overcome problems both in creating codes and interpretating results. Now I have better understanding of R language and am able to do stuff I never even dreamed of: creating my own web page, uploading real l ife data to R, wrangle it so it is possible to make different analyses and actually have a better understanding of those analysing techniques. I have a lot to learn but this has been a great start for a beginner like me.

I want to thank the whole group, especially all you assistants and leader Kimmo Vehkalahti. I never imagined I could learn so much in so little time.
